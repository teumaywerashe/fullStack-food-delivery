## ⚙️ Environment Variables

The backend uses environment variables for configuration.

### Create a `backend/.env` file. Example:

```env
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://<user>:<password>@cluster.mongodb.net/<dbname>
JWT_SECRET=<your_jwt_secret>
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:5173
NODE_ENV=development
# Optional: storage or third-party credentials (Cloudinary, AWS, etc.)
```

### Frontend `.env` (Vite) example:

```env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
```

## ▶️ Run Locally

### Backend

```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```
